Note: After training a deep learning model in keras, I output the weights and structure of this pre-trained model (wordCNNmodel). The python code to do this is below. The h5 and json files in this folder are saved from the code below.

#For production model
#Save the model (for production)
# serialize model to JSON
model_json = wordCNNModel.to_json()
with open("model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)
# serialize weights to HDF5
wordCNNModel.save_weights("model.h5")
